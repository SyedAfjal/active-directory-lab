## Project Overview

As shown in the diagram, this project simulates a **Windows network environment** using **VirtualBox** to demonstrate how **Active Directory (AD)** works. The setup involves creating two virtual machines: one for the **Active Directory Server** (Domain Controller) and another for the **UserPC** (Windows 10). 

### Project Goals:
- Create and configure a **Windows domain environment** using **Server 2019** and **Windows 10**.
- Set up **Active Directory** on the AD Server and create a domain (**mytechdomain.local**).
- Configure networking so the **UserPC** can access the internet through the **AD Server**.
- Enable **DHCP** on the AD Server to automatically assign IP addresses to the **UserPC**.
- Join the **UserPC** to the domain and log in with domain accounts.
- Explore and troubleshoot different Active Directory tasks to demonstrate my understanding of AD concepts.

This project is designed to showcase my skills in **Active Directory**, **network configuration**, and **Windows Server management**.
